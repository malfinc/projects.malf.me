<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>What is Dun-Gensis?</h3>
<p class="indented">
  Dun-Genesis is a suite of tools for worldbuilders, game-masters, storytellers and anyone else who is interested in fantasy worlds. Designed to be powerful but approachable, it can create an entire universe (Called 'Worlds) at the touch of a button, with each element able to be edited or replaced until it's something you find suitable.
</p>

<h3>What is a World?</h3>
<p class="indented">
  In the Dun-Genesis system, a 'world' is a distinct continutity and container
  of story. The contents of a world, from its people to its cultures, will be
  unique to it. While other worlds can generate similar content, this world is
  particular in its customization and totality.
</p>

<h3>What is a Culture?</h3>
<p class="indented">
  Dun-Genesis defines a culture as a block of people who share language, history
  and values. We don't define 'elven' culture or 'dwarven' culture, but rather,
  cultures have their own ethnic mixtures based on the territories and locations
  they control.
</p>

<p>Here's an example culture.</p>
<aside class="block--thick">
  <p><strong>The Eweniaan people</strong></p>
  <p class="indented">
    The Eweniaan are a flourishing spiritual civilization, who's primary
    pantheon is the Organized Trunk. Their patron diety is Jirost√Ωn, the God of
    zeal and metals. They live a mostly urban lifestyle, with wealth highly
    centralized in their ruling class.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    The Eweniaan people mostly speak Southern Saxotilach-Uriaalpan, Central
    Eweniaan and Classic Eweniaan. They are known for their cultural
    appreciation of the performing arts, with a special love for acrobatics, and
    for their fine cuisine. Eweniaan styles, be it clothing or jewelery, are
    seen as status symbols in most of the civilized world.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    Staunch traditionalists, the Eweniaan people look to their ancestors with
    pride for founding the first Republic. Eweniaan miners and metalworkers are
    very skilled, while their military is known for their scouts, especially in
    the mountains.

<h3>What is an Encounter?</h3>
<p class="indented">
  An encounter in Dun-Genesis' system, is a environment, such as a room or glade
  or cavern, coupled with an obstacle to overcome - such as a group of monsters,
  a trap, a roleplaying scenario or... all of the above... or none of the above.
  We provide many elements to choose from - but in the end, the Storyteller has
  control.
